<h2>About</h2>
<p>My name is Summer, and I am originally from Wisconsin. After graduating from UW-Madison, I moved to China for 3.5 years, then to Bolivia for 2.5 years. 
Currently, I am living in Durham, NC and have lived here for 3 years. My hobbies include learning guitar and singing, as well as reading science fiction and fantasy. I also enjoy writing, playing video games and studying languages.</p>
